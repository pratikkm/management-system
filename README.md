This project is based on python and cx_oracle.
Student result analysis is a web based application developed for colleges to
analyze the result and keep track of students progress.Student result analysis system has been designed to
carry out the mark analysis process in an educational institution. The results of
respective departments can be efficiently computed without much of manual
involvement. Given the continuous rise in student population, tertiary institutions
calculate examination result of students with the help of computer programs.
Analysis of students information and their academic record is as important as
examination result computation. The need for data use to inform decision-making
in tertiary institutions cannot be overemphasized. Over the years, many
algorithms and programs to compute examination result of students have been
developed.
The project objectives are: -
-->To store the student result records
-->To provide a overall graph of student.To design a user-friendly graphical user
   interface
